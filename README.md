# pytorch-containers

This repository aims to help former Torchies more seemlessly transition to the "Containerless" world of 
[PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) 
by providing a list of PyTorch implementations of [Torch Table Layers](https://github.com/torch/nn/blob/master/doc/table.md).
