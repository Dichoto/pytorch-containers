# pytorch-containers

This repository aims to help former Torchies more seemlessly transition to the "Containerless" world of 
[PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) 
by providing a list of PyTorch implementations of [Torch Table Layers](https://github.com/torch/nn/blob/master/doc/table.md).

We will build our neural net from a simple nn.Sequential() module as this exists in both 
Torch and PyTorch and build up from there.  You will notice that as we add more and more  
complexity to our network, the Torch code becomes more and more verbose.  On the other hand,
thanks to autograd, the complexity of our PyTorch code does not increase at all.
